Welcome to my profile.

I am a full-stack engineer with a background in Physics & Topography.
I have always been interested in the fundamentals of ‘how things work’.
I am inspired by the rapid development of software and technology, and the leverage it can provide in solving problems and the levelling-up effect I believe is possible with the new web technologies.
